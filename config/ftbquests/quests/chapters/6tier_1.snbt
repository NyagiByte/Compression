				"1) You really should only have &bone apothecary per recipe&r. While you can do many recipes in one the &cthroughput on all items becomes lower and ensuring it doesnt choke becomes a lot harder.&r"
				""
				"2) A very simple (&bamount of droppers&r = &6amount of items&r + &athe seed/catalyst item&r) &d((as an example, the &epure daisy&d is &64 petals&d + &a1 seed&d so you'd put &b5 droppers&d above the apothecary))&r in a tower above the apothecary would very easily do the job. It's not very elegant but it will do the craft"
				""
				"3) Attaching &bcomparators&r to the dispensers and wiring them up to some kind of &btimer&r can ensure the set up doesnt try to craft if any component is missing from the craft"
